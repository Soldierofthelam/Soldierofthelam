- 👋 Hi, I’m @Soldierofthelam
- 👀 I’m interested in ... I do numerious scripts across different game servers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Everything because every scripts always updates so you always are learning something new.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

    I do not tolerate cocky scripters on here.
    
     I'f I'm having issues with your script Imma tell you what your doing wrong, If you think I'm wrong I will tell you if in fact I am wrong.
     
     
    I DO NOT put up with know it alls.
    
    this includes the little man "MonkeyWhisper" who continues to get schooled after asking a simple question about a script and got owned when he got
   called out on horrible attitude of not reading a proper sentence and understanding the question instead reverted to attacking the individual because MonkeyWhisper lacks the intelligence to a proper dialect with a person who had a concearned question.
   Props to you MonkeyWhisper  for earning the biggest terd nugget award in chatter.
   
   He now tries to say 2500 servers are using his scripts when in fact if you look at the data (9.23%) out of 2500 is using his script
   The Man cannot even read a statistic properly
